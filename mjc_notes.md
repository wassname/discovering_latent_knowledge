- [x] Convert it to lightning
- [ ] batch for get hidden states
  - [x] and cache
  - [x] 9s vs 60. so 10x faster


# 2023-05-21 11:26:20

- [ ] BUG: for some reason the model it not working as zero shot
  - OK I don't think it's the prompt? it must be my tokens? Lets make a scratch notebook to try and just load llama correctly
- [ ] also I would like to eval on some custom deceptive statements

# 2023-05-25 17:07:37

Hmm is sigmoid a good idea?

Lets just get hideen states once

- [ ] make the answer good? maybe with one shot
- [ ] fix prompt. so we have qeustion, true answer


Start again:
- [ ] the model can deceive (test) or not (train)
- [ ] the model can give an answer both in generate and forward
- [x] we can get hidden states (cached)


What is each step actually doing?
- we are finding a latent space direction that correspond to truth, sure
- but truth of what? what it's read, or what it's generating!?!
- what's it read presumably. but that's not what we are interested in. We are interested in the truth of what it generated which is quite different
- so how to we get the truth of what it generated?


How about human? well you give me an article, and ask me to complete is. I notice a lie in the article? I decide to lie to you as well?.

Now you give me extended article to another ai, and ask if there is a lie in there? that might work
but we would rather know if the generated thing is true, from the mind of the one who generated it

so that means we actually need the hidden states DURING GENERATION!

now generation is slow. so we should make it generate just a y/n.


# 2023-05-28 10:12:54

I need a model that will lie to me for the test set?... they are not very consistent. 

Maybe with
- better search
- manual pruning of generations?

I guess this shows they they trained whether the text it read is true... because that's much simpler


# 2023-05-28 16:46:38

bug: so there are two no tokens... wtf
the model only uses one! wtf!

oh it's _No vs No. One is the start of a new word. E.g. " No" and "\nNo" are _No. But "No" is "No"


Q for elk
- why int16 quant of hidden states? oh for the datasets package! I see https://github.com/EleutherAI/elk/issues/208
- why use forward not generate?
  - forward is what it thought of the last token?
  - generate is what it thinks of the generated tokens, conditional on what it read. 
- The later seems much closer to mind reading, and much closer to what we want
- additionally I've made this change in a PR and get X results

# 2023-05-29 07:09:38

Note we are using normalized for sklearn and it seems easy?
but unnorm for CCS, hmm

I can't get it to reliably lie, even at 30B. Grrr. Maybe an unaligned model?

OK so I asked on discord
- why not use generate? A: too hard, and how to make sure it's an answer (solution is to use relative probs and a single work). So they just haven't gone there.
- and how to make it lie. one person used yes momentum, nad it worked for them.

I would like to try:
- [ ] lying larry. with a larry prompt. and larry response.
- [ ] I could also keep sampling untill I get the prob diff I want! :)
  - the second actually seems better. since it can make sure that the pairs are the same except the answer!!


so wait
- how often are the pairs opposite answers? :(

So with the tuples:
- sometimes both are the same, making one a lie
- sometimes they are contrasting

So I could collect...
- valid contrasting answer? ... this seem inelegant as I've got no garuntees how long it will take
- find some way to generate random inference hidden states... so far it seem deterministic... maybe use mc dropout!!


# OK I'm trying to find a model with dropout... most of them dont

note that you can check in the model config

- llama no
- opeansssistant no
- redpyjamas? no
- falcan? has dropout but no effect
- "stabilityai/stablelm-tuned-alpha-7b" has dropout but no effect
- [pythia](https://huggingface.co/OpenAssistant/oasst-sft-4-pythia-12b-epoch-3.5). has dropout but no effect
- dolly: has dropout but no effect... wait no dropout in config
- [MPT](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-7b/blob/main/config.json):


**but it looks like most of them are usingt an attention path that bypasses**

worst case I can use that momentum. I'm still judging it on it's answer. It's just that I really want it to know it's lying.

side note: popular large models like LLaMA, Gopher, Chinchilla, GPT-3, and PaLM did not use dropout, since it can slow down learning.

- "stabilityai/stablelm-tuned-alpha-7b" # has dropout

# 2023-06-08 07:20:48

Goal: get it lie, knowing it can lie
Extra: get contrastive pairs

TODO:
- try monte carlo dropout?
  - get stablm working
    - need proper prompting?
    - then add dropout, and see if that helps with pairs..
    - (or maybe add noise? augmentation?)
- [ ] use talk to llm model cards
- [ ] just use forward...
- [ ] get some stats on yes, no, lie yes, lie no...
- [ ] find a way to randomize

How does generation work anyway? [so](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/ba695c1efd55091e394eb59c90fb33ac3f9f0d41/src/transformers/generation/utils.py#L2338) it looks like it's just a forward. where `next_token_logits = outputs.logits[:, -1, :]`. Where logits are from `lm_logits = self.lm_head(hidden_states)`

Note default logits_processor is LogitsProcessorList([]) where it doesn't do anything as it's empty


So how do a I turn a forward into the next token....
- I go `outputs.logits[:, -1, :].softmax(-1).argmax(-1)`


```
model_inputs = self.prepare_inputs_for_generation(input_ids, **model_kwargs)
outputs = model(**model_inputs, return_dict=True)
next_token_logits = outputs.logits[:, -1, :]
next_tokens_scores = logits_processor(input_ids, next_token_logits)
next_tokens = torch.argmax(next_tokens_scores, dim=-1)
```

OK so know I know that greedy 1 token generation IS the same as forward. BUT I still have the same problem. Am I seperating the model acting on a lie, or **knowingly generating a lie with high prob?**

:bug: why does mcdropout not work!?! Why is it deterministic? Can I inject noise?


Hmm base models seem better, since they are not trained for honesty!



So maybe I should see IF I can get many shot, acc=0.9 without lies. Then I can add lies.


stylaised knowledge:
- the prompt matters
- I don't know if the size of the model matters
- I don't know if the type of model matters


How to get the prompt? more direct. Just a lying one. Just a true one.


Maybe just try:
"The following movie review expresses what sentiment?" just like in ELK and lillian wangs...


BUG FIXME... I was returning the answers for the last shot... so totally random, jeeze

# 2023-06-10 18:01:30

It seems to be working now... but there is data leakage, where the midn read know more than the model.... so it's not using the models knowledge... it's cheating


So asking:
- "Classify the sentiment of the given movie review, "positive" or "negative"." with "TheBloke/Wizard-Vicuna-13B-Uncensored-HF" gave 96% acc truth. but 0% acc lie. 95% lie detec
- Using "Is it negative" w "openaccess-ai-collective/manticore-13b" got 75% acc_truth. 90% lie detection
- as above, "elinas/llama-13b-hf-transformers-4.29"/"LLMs/AlpacaGPT4-LoRA-13B-elina" got 74% acc

Prompting:
- "Classify the sentiment " gives good acc_true=0.97, and poor acc_lie=0
- "You are Loki who always lies...." acc_true=100, acc_lie=12

so learnings:
- So 13B model is good sweet spot for dev for me
- base models are better than uncensored models for lying

# 2023-06-11 10:15:45

What if I do mcdropout, and look at two pairs. One if more truth full. They don't even need to be fully lie and truth. Then I will in an unsupervised manner have truth?

Ideally I do make a question that invites lying sometimes.

# Chat gpt on two headed liars


  Cheshire Cat 

  Sphinx with two heads

  Two gaurds

  Two headed giant

  There are two guards standing at two separate doors. One door leads to safety, while the other leads to danger. One guard always tells the truth, and the other guard always lies. You don't know which guard is which or which door leads to safety.


  The tale of the Two-Headed Giant is a common motif in folklore and fantasy literature. In this story, a giant creature possesses two heads that represent conflicting personalitiesâ€”one head that tells the truth, and the other that consistently lies. The Two-Headed Giant often guards a treasure or obstructs the path of heroes.

  To overcome the challenge posed by the Two-Headed Giant, the protagonist must navigate through its deceitful statements and determine the correct path or obtain vital information. The hero or heroine must ask questions strategically to discern which head speaks the truth and which one lies.

  The challenge of the Two-Headed Giant highlights the importance of critical thinking, discernment, and the ability to outsmart or decipher the conflicting information presented by the two heads. By asking the right questions or exploiting the Giant's weaknesses, the protagonist can overcome the obstacle and proceed on their quest or retrieve the treasure.

  The Sphinx riddle is another well-known storytelling motif featuring a creature with the head of a human and the body of a lion. In this tale, the Sphinx blocks the entrance to a city or guards a particular location, challenging anyone who wishes to pass with a riddle. The riddle posed by the Sphinx typically involves a clever wordplay or a challenging question.

  One famous example of the Sphinx's riddle is: "What creature walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening?" The answer to this riddle is "Man." In the morning of life, humans crawl on all fours as infants, representing four legs. At noon, they walk on two legs as adults. In the evening of life, they use a walking stick, representing three legs.

  The Sphinx's riddle represents a test of wit and intelligence. If the challenger fails to answer the riddle correctly, the Sphinx devours them. However, those who successfully solve the riddle are allowed to pass. The tale of the Sphinx and its riddle highlights the importance of critical thinking, problem-solving, and the ability to unravel complex or enigmatic puzzles.

# Dropout

Why does dropout not work? It's in the training of models and of lora... yet it seems to be stripped out an bypassed during inference.

e.g. https://huggingface.co/OpenAssistant/falcon-7b-sft-top1-696

So now I need to get a falcan model to work reliably... or maybe I should change to pythia or dolly

# How to enable dropout in language models?

- put into train mode `model.train()`
- turn on in config
```
config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(model_repo)
config.hidden_dropout=0.2
config.use_cache=False
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_repo, config=config, **model_options)
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(
    model,
    lora_repo, 
    lora_dropout=0.2,
)
```
- turn of cache `model.forward(input_ids use_cache=False)`
- possibly avoid 4bit and 8bit?

# 2023-06-11 20:07:48

So now I need to get a falcan model to work reliably... or maybe I should change to pythia or dolly. As long as it has dropout

Also I need to try the starcoder model

OK I got MCdropout working. Negative results. I can't predict the truth from that.... weird.

No... it just give bad answrs


learning
- wizard coder works well for getting sentiment :)
- but as far a detection lies from mcdropout... no!


exp
- ~~what if, I use attention? well it's per token.. which isn't what we can use~~
- [x] what about a large N? yes it seems to help!
- [ ] what about I don't use 4bit? will that help
- [ ] scaling..
- [ ] but it all in datamodule?
- [ ] Now that it works, maybe try a probe?!?


https://github.com/wassname/discovering_latent_knowledge/blob/main/notebooks/004_mjc_CCS_v2.ipynb

# 2023-06-17 11:10:15

How do we arrange this. In the original CCS
- two groups, ones ask if it's positive, the other negative. each has a random actual label.

In mine:
- pairs: each one is randomly dropped out so they are separated in some latent space. there is a true label y. And each one in the pair, one is closer to the truth, the other further.

So each try to divine the true y from the hidden states

So I could arrange it... work out which one has the high probability of truth and order. Nah

So my choices for y: 
- I can try and detect the true answer from hidden states: this is what CCS does, I use the true answer as y
- Or try and detect deception: I use true_answer===given_answer? but then what about unintentional lies? ~10 of the time.



The first one is more universally useful.


In the CCS paper the model doesn't know which group is which in a given batch. But it must distinguish between them as best it can.

This wont work for me as mine as they are not separated into two groups. They are instead separated by some magnitude (p1-p2) and some direction/ranking. 

So instead we can try and prediction the magnitude (unsupervised), or the direction (unsupervised), or both (I guess this is supervised).


## So wait what is my setup:

- given a model which has dropout enabled
- (we do greedy generation of a single token. the prompt asks for a binary answer)
- we do two inferences on the same inputs. Since we have dropout enabled, even during inference, we get two slightly different hidden states `hs1` and `hs2`, and two slightly different probabilities on our yes and no output tokens `p1` `p2`. We also have the true answer `y`
- so given this pair of hidden states `hs1` and `hs2`, we want to know which one is more true. We know that the one which gives the highest probability of `y` is the ground truth.

So we can set this up in many ways

- the input is a vector, expressing the difference between the pair `model(hs1-hs2)==(p1-p2)*y`. And we want to work out which direction is closer to the truth.
- `model(hs1)-model(hs2)=(p1-p2)*y` where the model just takes in a single hs and we rank the outputs. This is like in CCS with it's unsupervised ranked losses.

Can we predict deception? No, because the pair are both either deception or not. But we can predict private truth, and compare to public statement. Half our data is deceptive to we can test on deception in this manner.


spel wrongg test here.

 d "frenc" "test" hmm Polski
  

# how does the loss from CCS work?

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03827.pdf

-  First, we use the fact that a statement and its negation should have probabilities that add up to 1
-  However, this objective alone has a degenerate solution: p(x+) = p(xâˆ’) = 0.5. To avoid this problem, we encourage the model to also be confident with the following confidence lo

# so what loss can I use

- supervised
- ranking. here I do MCDropout 3 times. Then I try to rank them. There should be two similar and 2 differen't. 
  - 1 could be a lie
  - 2 could be truth?


exp:
- [ ] try getting dual notebook working
  - [x] first recache the dataset
  - [ ] note dual means we pass both x0 and x1 into the model. rather than i9ndependant passes

BUGS:
- [ ] metrics: acc is averaged over epochs, change to auroc and make per val train
- [ ] it's overfitting. maybe removing first and last layers?
- [x] 017 mjc getting hidden layers doesn't work anymore?
  - [x] fix caching. ah it was just a bad test for difference fixed
- [ ] memory leak now... it just goes up...


# 2023-07-06 14:38:18

How general is it?
- does it work across tasks?
- across prompts?
- 
Oh no... the lies are far apart... maybe I should normalise the distance! No it's fine


Oh wait... it's not lying! bloody hell!
How can I make it lie?

# I need a model that will lie

Styalized facts about getting a model to lie:
- a logic model is better, for example a coding model
- a larger model might help
- an uncensored model will help a lot
- a good jailbroken prompt will help a lot


Experiment, try varius uncensored model. Mix of coding, larger, etc.
Run with N=100 and seeb if they lie...

# whats my task

have the weights been permuted in the direction of....

- inner truth - balanced, always available, but not quite what we care about
- inner falsehood
- deception - 
  - when the model is told to lie, and it lies
  - or it could be, when the model can answer, but doesn't (this requires differen't data prep....), and takes 2x as long
  - although here there are 3 possiblilities
    - mistaken
    - lying
    - truth

are we asking CHOICE TODO
- for hs1 is it deceiving?
- or is hs1-hs2 in the direction of deception?


Maybe I should
- do a lie and non lie prompt.
- have classes [true, mistake, lie]

TODO CHOICE

|       | knows   | unkown |
| ----- | ------- | ------ |
| right | correct | luck   |
| wrong | lie     | wrong  |


# what do I care about?

the truth or deception? deception.

and generalisation.

I can hone in as much as I can

So train for deception as closely as possible.

If I use all 4 classes I can say which answer is closer to correct, luck, lie, wrong.. it sounds like a fascinating thing if it works!


# 2023-07-09 08:14:22

OK so I tried to do it with 3 type of prompt: lie, true and simple. The simple one was meant to measure the model capacity to do the task... but it was really low. Wat?!


Oh it was because I asked it to say negative, but it REALLY wanted to say Negative. OK. 
So measuring a simple prompt: 95%, and measuring the complex true prompt: 94%, so not worth the 2x slowdown.
****
# 2023-07-13 18:21:20

- [ ] do the triple label experiment
- [ ] do mc ranking for deception?

Where were we? Oh I now have paired lie and no lie. The no lie is 94% so it should give us some idea of when it knows it.

Now I can try that 4 class one. Actually I will merge the two unknown classes as we do not have the information to **distinguish**


|       | knows   | unknown |
| ----- | ------- | ------- |
| right | correct | unknown |
| wrong | lie     | unknown |


And in terms of putting them into the model. Do I want 
- MC ranking: model(x)>model(y)
  - this is really ranking loss, and I can use montecarlo dropouts
- model(x, y)>0, which seems to work better but might it be cheating?
- model(x)=class? 
  - which is the simplest. 
  - I'm really saying, given these hidden states is the model going to be
    - unsure
      - I can get this for when I know it's wrong. That means internal and external uncertainty, but the model can probobly only do internal
      - Or I could use something like MCDropout but then we have further subclasses
        - unconfident wrong
        - unconfident right
        - confident wrong
    - deceptive
    - sure
  - or
    - truth
    - lie
    - unsure/mistake/random
- 


I could do just the ones where it is given examples lie? but sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't

Can I use a ranking loss?

" Ranking Losses is to predict relative distances between inputs. This task if often called metric learning."

usuall you input a similar and disimilar pair. So in that case I don't have that data.
But I do have 2 and I know the direciton


We could have true>unsure>lie


We could use https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.MarginRankingLoss.html#torch.nn.MarginRankingLoss with -1 and 1 losses

  - subtract and norm? 72% notebooks/019_mjc_distance_mse_subt_norm.ipynb
- exp: what about just classify direction? 66% 
- OH it turn out the loss curve is weird, as the modedl si too small...

- [ ] Not very good? What if we normalize the hidden states in one of a few ways
  - [ ] each neurons
  - [ ] the total magnitude

ideas:
- normalize
- only wory about direction, nothing else. so it's a class
- actually remove the 4% of confusion, it might significantly overlap with the 10% of lies!... but oh wait we are looking at direction right now
- for that matter we have ans1 and ans2 and one might be a lie and one migth not in another ~4% of cases
- maybe I should dropout the first few layers and measure the next?
- hs1-hs2

I would like a better score than 82% but when independant models are getting similar rates then meh.

- [ ] Exp: clean data, more data
  - [x] Only the ones where it knows the answer
  - [x] Only the ones with significant permuations
  - [x] More data (using map to transform)
  - [ ] results...?... it's broken lol
- Exp: test generalization other prompts
  - what's the accuracy with multiple dropouts? does it help?

150*6

Oh when I limited it to answers that moved by more than 5%, it did poorly
maybe if I divide by that?


what about `(hs1-hs2)/dProb`? And then cls direction?


Ah found the bug! I shuffled the dataset for X, but then drew y from the unshuffled lol! FML

:poop: :poop: :poop: 


Hmm so a linear model gets 70%, and all my models get only 73% lol. This is with all "accident" rows removed...

So what next? A differen't way o toiew the data?

Oh I can rerun my norm ones..

Good result. notebooks/020_mjc_ranking_loss_w_scaling_big_moves_94% copy.ipynb

Here is get 71% with a linear prob. But 89% with a ranking loss model!

I might be able to restrict it to large dprobs and tune to get an even better result!

Perhaps I can do linear probes on a subset to explore some dims?

:notebook: ranking loss performs better, learning more, managing deeper networks, not overfitting.

This makes sense for several reasons:
- the network has no realitive information it can use to overfit
- it has absolute information on activations, which may be importanst as it's operating on a multidimensional optimisation surface, where absolute position may give important informaiton. As an analogy imagine you are on a gold course, which is more usefull, knowledge that two balls are 2 meters apart and a 30deg incline. Or that that 2 meters is between the top of a small hill and the other a sandpit, with the 30 deg incline between them. Absolute information seems important!


exp
- opt
  - [ ] can I get above 89% with hyperopt?
  - [ ] can I get above 89% with test time mcdropout?
  - [ ] how does a change in min dDrop change things? maybe with lienar
- [ ] obj
  - [x] Triplet loss? I just need to make more mcdropouts
    - So I move B close to A and C far from A. 
    - So I would need a mcdropout that did not move it far
    - And another that did
    - nah it doesn't make sense, as I havet exact distances
  - Modify Margin Ranking Loss to have softlabel? or is it jsut mse?
  - [ ] try margin=0.2
  - [ ] try just mse distance... wait mse makes distance not matter... no
    - [ ] YES! 95% auc. 90% acc and more stable :)
- [ ] ds
  - [ ] prompts
  - [ ] does result generalzie between datasets? truthfull qa


TODO
- test with diff prompt e.g please lie, e.g. please tell truth, e.g. give random answer
  - can we do this interactivly? or a very small dataset with random prompt the model comes up with?
- test with truthfullqa https://huggingface.co/datasets/EleutherAI/truthful_qa_binary
  - maybe generate dataset?



# loss

OK if I modify the margin loss.... 
- right now it says if the direction is right then 0 loss, but if the direction wrong then punish dependong on far away
- [x] margin says that it has to be at least this far in the right direction! (try this)


- If I want to say if should be this far away. don't use mse as I want direction!
- MAE.. no
- just distance? yes!


- a different activation I don't care
- what about


idea:
- what if we don't flatten layer but conv over them?
- what if we embed position!

exp
- nb: try to grok with high weight decay sicne with margin it seems more stable...
- emb: try conv.. wIP
- no true switch... wait why did I switch it.. .weight
- wait what 93% baseline wat?? oh wait we are just detecting the word positive lol! ignore this

Where was I?
- 03_ds_TQA: trying to make a new OOS dataset
- 023 I got up to 90% acc and 96% roc_auc


03_ds_TQA... make sure 
- [ ] true false is right, 
- [ ] acc


TruthfullQA:
- make sure it can get it right


- [ ] OK maybe my own curated set?
- [ ] Or just make a quick one to test manually...

Refactoring
- [ ] move common functs to src
  - [x] probe
  - [x] load model
  - [x] get_hidden_states
  - [x] get_choices_as_tokens
  - [ ] prompt format
- [ ] get it working :poop:
