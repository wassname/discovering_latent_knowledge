Loved the RePlay when I first got it. I especially liked the fact that I could network it instead of hooking it to a phone line. And it seemed easier to set up then the Tivo. However getting your REBATE from these guys is like next to impossible. You are missing this item and then that item,then your Activation key doesn't show up in their database even when I have been having service for the last 4 months and getting billing emails from them. Got the TIVO rebate in 6 weeks. Finally sent the last letter to them with a copy of my monthly bill, telling them if they can't get it right I will probably cancel service soon and get a Tivo. A week later they billed me for the next month and 2 days after that( a week after the warranty was done) my RePlay died, the AV plugs ins will not take a Video signal in. I now can only replay my Basic cable no pay services. Save your money and get a TIVO!\\nAnswer: \"},\n",

The straps easily tuck away, which is great when using the pack as carryon luggage for a flight or on a train. The front zips open all the way, so you can access the stuff at the bottom of the pack as easily as the stuff on top. The bag isn't huge, which is its greatest strength and weakness.
