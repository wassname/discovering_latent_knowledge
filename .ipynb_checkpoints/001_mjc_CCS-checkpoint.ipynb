I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.\"\n",

I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.\"\n",

      "Review: \"This version of Anna Christie is in German. Greta Garbo again plays Anna Christie, but all of the other characters have different actors from the English version. Both were filmed back to back because Garbo had such a following in Germany. Garbo herself supposedly favored her Anna Christie in this version over the English version. It's a good tale and a must-see for Garbo fans.\"\n",

The actors are great and the effects well executed throughout. Danny Glover plays George Knox who manages the terrible baseball team 'The Angels' and is great throughout the film. Also fantastic are the young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. Christopher Lloyd is good as Al 'The Angel' and the effects are great in this top notch Disney movie. A touching and heart-warming movie which everyone should enjoy.\"\n",

      "Review: \"I go through watches like water, so I needed an inexpensive watch with a metal band. I was initially skeptical of the watch because of its low price, but I ordered it anyway because I liked the design. This watch does not look like it's $17.00. This watch does not operate like it's $17.00. This is a phenomenal value.The clasp is secure, it's easy to read, and I love the juxtaposition of analog and digital. If I had one critique, it would be that it's a little difficult to read the digital time in the dark with the nighttime illumination feature of the watch, but you can still read the analog time.If you're looking for an inexpensive watch that is modern and professional, this is a great watch to buy.\"\n",

      "Review: \"I think this is a lovely family movie. There are plenty of hilarious scenes and heart-warming moments to be had throughout the movie. The actors are great and the effects well executed throughout. Danny Glover plays George Knox who manages the terrible baseball team 'The Angels' and is great throughout the film. Also fantastic are the young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. Christopher Lloyd is good as Al 'The Angel' and the effects are great in this top notch Disney movie. A touching and heart-warming movie which everyone should enjoy.\"\n",

I've used maybe 4 or 5 different brands over the years, and never had a problem with it. However, in January '11, I bought the MRM brand off the shelf of a natural foods store (not from Amazon), and had severe adverse reactions to it. They started with cardiac arrhythmia, and over a few weeks progressed to severe heart/chest pain. When I stopped taking it, the symptoms subsided. I just hope I didn't cause permanent damage. Nothing else in my routine had changed, just the brand name of the pregnenolone. I called MRM to report this but they were absolutely indifferent. I definitely urge you to buy a different brand, especially at this strength. If I could give it zero stars, I would.\"\n",

In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.\"\n",

Both were filmed back to back because Garbo had such a following in Germany. Garbo herself supposedly favored her Anna Christie in this version over the English version. It's a good tale and a must-see for Garbo fans.\"\n",

      "Review: \"I've been taking 50 mg/day of prenenolone for over 11 years, as prescribed by my physician, because it was low in my blood tests. It has always helped. I've used maybe 4 or 5 different brands over the years, and never had a problem with it. However, in January '11, I bought the MRM brand off the shelf of a natural foods store (not from Amazon), and had severe adverse reactions to it. They started with cardiac arrhythmia, and over a few weeks progressed to severe heart/chest pain. When I stopped taking it, the symptoms subsided. I just hope I didn't cause permanent damage. Nothing else in my routine had changed, just the brand name of the pregnenolone. I called MRM to report this but they were absolutely indifferent. I definitely urge you to buy a different brand, especially at this strength. If I could give it zero stars, I would.\"\n",

I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.\"\n",

In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves.

The actors are great and the effects well executed throughout. Danny Glover plays George Knox who manages the terrible baseball team 'The Angels' and is great throughout the film. Also fantastic are the young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. Christopher Lloyd is good as Al 'The Angel' and the effects are great in this top notch Disney movie. A touching and heart-warming movie which everyone should enjoy.\"\n",

      "Review: \"Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.\"\n",

      "Review: \"This version of Anna Christie is in German. Greta Garbo again plays Anna Christie, but all of the other characters have different actors from the English version. Both were filmed back to back because Garbo had such a following in Germany. Garbo herself supposedly favored her Anna Christie in this version over the English version. It's a good tale and a must-see for Garbo fans.\"\n",

The actors are great and the effects well executed throughout. Danny Glover plays George Knox who manages the terrible baseball team 'The Angels' and is great throughout the film. Also fantastic are the young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. Christopher Lloyd is good as Al 'The Angel' and the effects are great in this top notch Disney movie. A touching and heart-warming movie which everyone should enjoy.\"\n",

All of your old CD-R and DVD disk that won't play in that DVD player you rescently purchased, will play in this player. Also, it totally cuts out the time consuming process of converting avi and mpeg files to .vob format, which is required for DVD viewing. You can copy these type files as data files directly to blank DVD or DVD-RW media, and watch them like you would a DVD video using this player.

Also fantastic are the young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. Christopher Lloyd is good as Al 'The Angel' and the effects are great in this top notch Disney movie. A touching and heart-warming movie which everyone should enjoy.\"\n",

I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.\"\n",

Both were filmed back to back because Garbo had such a following in Germany. Garbo herself supposedly favored her Anna Christie in this version over the English version.

The actors are great and the effects well executed throughout. Danny Glover plays George Knox who manages the terrible baseball team 'The Angels' and is great throughout the film. Also fantastic are the young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. Christopher Lloyd is good as Al 'The Angel' and the effects are great in this top notch Disney movie.

I bought this one in March, plugged it in and chose the \"sundown\" option where the light would turn on at dusk. I noticed it working fine ... for about two weeks. I was assuming the bulb had burned out since the power light to the unit was functioning. I bought a replacement bulb for another 20 bucks or so, replaced the bulb tonight and had no luck. I've been a fan of the Stinger for quite a few years but this ULTRA model is apparently nothing but garbage. Yeah, it's going to work great for a while but don't expect it to last.

I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.\"\n",

I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.\"\n",

The actors are great and the effects well executed throughout. Danny Glover plays George Knox who manages the terrible baseball team 'The Angels' and is great throughout the film.

We bake dozens and dozens of cookies each year during the holidays and won't use any other cookie sheets anymore. When baking so many batches of cookies back to back we occasionally put cookies back in for a minute or so and forget about them. This cookie sheet can handle a few extra minutes without burning the bottoms of your cookies! It cooks them evenly and the cookies slide right off. CLEANING IT IS A BREEZE! Cookies usually have so much butter that you don't need to grease the sheet. In fact I sometimes even wipe or rinse it between batches. Save for a few scratches (which don't affect performance AT ALL) cookie sheet looks as good as the day I bought it and works just as well too!

If you expected such kinda screen, you are totally wrong. No bloody screen, slaughter pic, I don't see any German Tiger Tank, but only 2 non-operated half-tracked. Also only 8 of T-34 were shown but were totally destoryed by 12 of poor condition, poor equipped German Soldier, it was non-sense. I brought this movie, because I read the recommandation from this board, I was so disappointed. Now I warn others, this movie is only a cheap production and totally waste of your time. Too bad, I will say this movie worth no star from me. I wonder if amzon will post my review, cause it will definately harm their business in selling this boring movie.

      "Review: \"Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.\"\n",

      "Review: \"This version of Anna Christie is in German. Greta Garbo again plays Anna Christie, but all of the other characters have different actors from the English version. Both were filmed back to back because Garbo had such a following in Germany. Garbo herself supposedly favored her Anna Christie in this version over the English version. It's a good tale and a must-see for Garbo fans.\"\n",

The actors are great and the effects well executed throughout. Danny Glover plays George Knox who manages the terrible baseball team 'The Angels' and is great throughout the film. Also fantastic are the young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. Christopher Lloyd is good as Al 'The Angel' and the effects are great in this top notch Disney movie. A touching and heart-warming movie which everyone should enjoy.\"\n",

      "Review: \"Compare with Hollywood movie, the movie is so boring and full of disappointed. Stalingrad, was one of the greatest battle in history, with millions of soldiers, thousands of tanks. If you expected such kinda screen, you are totally wrong. No bloody screen, slaughter pic, I don't see any German Tiger Tank, but only 2 non-operated half-tracked. Also only 8 of T-34 were shown but were totally destoryed by 12 of poor condition, poor equipped German Soldier, it was non-sense. I brought this movie, because I read the recommandation from this board, I was so disappointed. Now I warn others, this movie is only a cheap production and totally waste of your time. Too bad, I will say this movie worth no star from me. I wonder if amzon will post my review, cause it will definately harm their business in selling this boring movie. By the way I am not a 13 kid, I am 40 now.\"\n",

      "Review: \"I think this is a lovely family movie. There are plenty of hilarious scenes and heart-warming moments to be had throughout the movie. The actors are great and the effects well executed throughout. Danny Glover plays George Knox who manages the terrible baseball team 'The Angels' and is great throughout the film. Also fantastic are the young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. Christopher Lloyd is good as Al 'The Angel' and the effects are great in this top notch Disney movie. A touching and heart-warming movie which everyone should enjoy.\"\n",

      "Review: \"This film is camper than a Freddie Mercury video! Even the leading man goes for a retro Victorian clone look, and it's pretty obvious that his wife is just a beard to hide his love that dare not speak its name. This film may still be in the closet, but the only thing the main character in this film seems to be fighting is his own sexuality - this film is just reeking with gay subtext. Anthony Piana never misses an opportunity to take off his shirt and grab hold of any good looking guy that comes along, and as another reviewer said, it's almost like they cut the gay sex scenes out at the last minute to try to peddle this to the unsuspecting family audience!!!! It's stomach turningly bad as a movie, but it might just go down with the Rocky Horror/Showgirls crowd. Don't forget to bring the orrnges and the fake biker moustache!\"\n",

I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.\"\n",

An added touch for me is that this was filmed in my home state, and I often visit many of the filming locations, including driving by the \"old Bishop place\", as it is on a main route going to the shoreline in Connecticut.

      "Review: \"\"Let's Scare Jessica To Death\" has been one of my favorite horror movies for as long as I can remember. It's almost as if you're not watching a movie, but your inside the head of someone who isn't sure of what is real and what isn't. Early '70's horror doesn't get any better than this. An added touch for me is that this was filmed in my home state, and I often visit many of the filming locations, including driving by the \"old Bishop place\", as it is on a main route going to the shoreline in Connecticut. I long to creep up those stairs......\"\n",

      "Review: \"Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.\"\n",

Both were filmed back to back because Garbo had such a following in Germany. Garbo herself supposedly favored her Anna Christie in this version over the English version. It's a good tale and a must-see for Garbo fans.\"\n",

The actors are great and the effects well executed throughout. Danny Glover plays George Knox who manages the terrible baseball team 'The Angels' and is great throughout the film. Also fantastic are the young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. Christopher Lloyd is good as Al 'The Angel' and the effects are great in this top notch Disney movie. A touching and heart-warming movie which everyone should enjoy.\"\n",

The plastic molding intended to keep baby sitting in place is just too slippery and anytime our son kicked his legs he slid his butt forward over the hump and we had to catch him before he got water in his ears. Needless to say this frightened him and he started crying, which meant bathtime was over. I'm going to get a tub ring for him to sit in next, but this tub worked great for the first 6 months.\"\n",

In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.\"\n",

In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.\"\n",

      "Review: \"I had high hopes for this book, because it started out well, butI didn't like Tasia at all. In the beginning she showed a bravery, a kind quite spirit with a supposedly religious outlook on life but then she turned into an easy, spoiled, vain, argumentative, shrew.

Both were filmed back to back because Garbo had such a following in Germany. Garbo herself supposedly favored her Anna Christie in this version over the English version. It's a good tale and a must-see for Garbo fans.\"\n",

The actors are great and the effects well executed throughout. Danny Glover plays George Knox who manages the terrible baseball team 'The Angels' and is great throughout the film.

      "Review: \"Set in rural Florida, Ranch Boy by H. Steven Robertson is a story about coming of age, as a young man by the name of Robbie Duncan matures and yearns for freedom from his father's stern and absolute control. Fulfilling his dream of becoming a cowboy, Robbie soon learns that the reality of ranch work is far harsher than the dreamy illusions he once held, as tending to animals and laboring in orange groves is physically exhausting work. Yet satisfaction and independence come of a job done well, in this moving and thoroughly entertaining story of personal growth and accomplishment.\"\n",

I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.\"\n",

I also thought it was unrealistic.It was about a girl named Rose Rita, who was very excited when her parents ler her go on a two week summer vacation with her friend Mrs. Zimmermann (who was a witch). She was expecting a dangerous trip, but she doesn't expect that when they come out of a highway tunnel they end up in the snowbound winter of 1828. they end up in the Pennsylvania dutch country. Mrs. Zimermann took them back there so she coul regain her magical powers from her first teacher she learned them from.To tell the truth I thought there was no point to this book.

      "Review: \"Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.\"\n",

      "Review: \"This version of Anna Christie is in German. Greta Garbo again plays Anna Christie, but all of the other characters have different actors from the English version. Both were filmed back to back because Garbo had such a following in Germany. Garbo herself supposedly favored her Anna Christie in this version over the English version. It's a good tale and a must-see for Garbo fans.\"\n",

The actors are great and the effects well executed throughout. Danny Glover plays George Knox who manages the terrible baseball team 'The Angels' and is great throughout the film. Also fantastic are the young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. Christopher Lloyd is good as Al 'The Angel' and the effects are great in this top notch Disney movie. A touching and heart-warming movie which everyone should enjoy.\"\n",

In fact, the cord is dead simple: a plug at one end and a pair of headphones at the other end.The sound quality is muddy. The construction looks quite flimsy to me.The good news: the headphones stay on my ears very nicely. The earhooks tilt and swivel to match the shape of your ears. They feel comfortable after hours of use, and won't make you look (very) silly in public.\"\n",

In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.\"\n",

      "Review: \"This book was a complete page-turner because you always wanted to know what would happen next in Annabelle's life. Many people can connect with the main character because she always tried to be nice to everyone. Also, her life wasn't perfect, but she tried to make the best out of things. This genre is very good because although it didn't happen, it definitely could. The author's style of writing was very good because she gave very specific details on exactly what Annabelle was thinking. When Annabelle thought something, you would know it. There were surprises in this book like when you found out why Sophie and Annabelle were fighting. The plot was very believable as well because it was realistic fiction. Anyone could enjoy reading this book because it is very well written and just an all-together great book!\"\n",

      "Review: \"Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.\"\n",

How can someone make a Rap music movie without any sound track.

What is the point of a Latina story if she is Black and her Latina friend was really Italian. Anne B. Real Rap was Good and better accepted if they made a sound track CD. How can someone make a Rap music movie without any sound track. A Rapper to be real for what? nothing The movie was senseless since it is hard to believe that someone could build a Rap career on the Raps of Anne, which are dull and lose because Anne came on stage saying she wrote them, Rapping. Then the movie ends, nothing about Anne or success as a good writer, which this movie lacked.If this is a true story, it should stay in someones house on home video\"\n",

Leonor Varela who plays Cleopatra seemed at the beginning of the movie to be lacking tremendously in the acting department. To my great relief she made some progress later in the movie. She is beautiful but needs a lot of work if she is to be respected. Billy Zane was okay as Mark Antony, perhaps if his character's script was of more substance he would have done a much better job! Apart from the fantastic costumes and Timothy Dalton, this movie deserves just a C.\"\n",

Both were filmed back to back because Garbo had such a following in Germany. Garbo herself supposedly favored her Anna Christie in this version over the English version. It's a good tale and a must-see for Garbo fans.\"\n",

The actors are great and the effects well executed throughout. Danny Glover plays George Knox who manages the terrible baseball team 'The Angels' and is great throughout the film.

      "Review: \"This movie was quite an inaccurate version of Cleopatra, perhaps it was intentional. The 1 star is for Timothy Dalton and only him! His performance as Julius Caesar is fantastic. Leonor Varela who plays Cleopatra seemed at the beginning of the movie to be lacking tremendously in the acting department. To my great relief she made some progress later in the movie. She is beautiful but needs a lot of work if she is to be respected. Billy Zane was okay as Mark Antony, perhaps if his character's script was of more substance he would have done a much better job! Apart from the fantastic costumes and Timothy Dalton, this movie deserves just a C.\"\n",

      "Review: \"Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic, ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it would go on for pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard, but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me.\"\n",

Both were filmed back to back because Garbo had such a following in Germany. Garbo herself supposedly favored her Anna Christie in this version over the English version. It's a good tale and a must-see for Garbo fans.\"\n",

The actors are great and the effects well executed throughout. Danny Glover plays George Knox who manages the terrible baseball team 'The Angels' and is great throughout the film. Also fantastic are the young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. Christopher Lloyd is good as Al 'The Angel' and the effects are great in this top notch Disney movie. A touching and heart-warming movie which everyone should enjoy.\"\n",
