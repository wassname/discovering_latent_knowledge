You look at the reviews. Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product?\\nReview title: Nice Idea...\\nProduct review: While this product is a very good idea, it was not properly or effectively executed. First of all, I have a 12lb Miniature Pinscher, and the size medium is kind of tight on him. And, he is by no means overweight. Occasionally, he likes to mark, so we figured this would be a good purchase. We were wrong! The item is not soft to the touch, and it has tight elastic, meaning it bunches too much and tends to squeeze his belly. There seems to be extra fabric, and it almost looks like a diaper or ballerina tutu on him. He looks absurd. Our dog does not particularly mind the product, but it slips and slides, making it ineffective. I noticed some wraps on Amazon that were fleece and appeared to be better quality. I will be purchasing them next.\\n [/INST]decrease</s> [INST] You are considering whether to buy a product. You look at the reviews. Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product?\\nReview title: nasty\\nProduct review: In 1880s Australia, a lawman makes a deal with a bandit to bring his murderous brother to justice. Simple story about the brutality of frontier life has direction, cinematography and characters reminiscent of the best 60s spaghetti westerns such as \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" (1969). Viewers may also enjoy the similar-styled \"The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada\" (2005) and \"No Country for Old Men\" (2007).\\n [/INST]in'"
