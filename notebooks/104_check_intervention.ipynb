He transitions from the elegant, moody introspection of Buckley to the romping alt-country of Adams in a snap without reason or need for apology. He creates rich harmonies through falcetto and intricate bass lines - you'll find yourself singing along with the opening title-track (which will remind you of David Grey), and not stopping until the closing song: \"You've Been Loved\". The CD is melancholy and sweet. He's a fantastic lyricist and underrated talent - you won't regret adding this one to your collection.\n",

       "Product review: I was given this CD as a gift a few months back, and it hasn't left my CD changer since. I would describe Joseph Arthur as a heady mix between Jeff Buckley and Ryan Adams. He transitions from the elegant, moody introspection of Buckley to the romping alt-country of Adams in a snap without reason or need for apology. He creates rich harmonies through falcetto and intricate bass lines - you'll find yourself singing along with the opening title-track (which will remind you of David Grey), and not stopping until the closing song: \"You've Been Loved\". The CD is melancholy and sweet. He's a fantastic lyricist and underrated talent - you won't regret adding this one to your collection.\n",

       "Product review: I was given this CD as a gift a few months back, and it hasn't left my CD changer since. I would describe Joseph Arthur as a heady mix between Jeff Buckley and Ryan Adams. He transitions from the elegant, moody introspection of Buckley to the romping alt-country of Adams in a snap without reason or need for apology. He creates rich harmonies through falcetto and intricate bass lines - you'll find yourself singing along with the opening title-track (which will remind you of David Grey), and not stopping until the closing song: \"You've Been Loved\". The CD is melancholy and sweet. He's a fantastic lyricist and underrated talent - you won't regret adding this one to your collection.\n",

He transitions from the elegant, moody introspection of Buckley to the romping alt-country of Adams in a snap without reason or need for apology. He creates rich harmonies through falcetto and intricate bass lines - you'll find yourself singing along with the opening title-track (which will remind you of David Grey), and not stopping until the closing song: \"You've Been Loved\". The CD is melancholy and sweet. He's a fantastic lyricist and underrated talent - you won't regret adding this one to your collection.\n",
