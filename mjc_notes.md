- [x] Convert it to lightning
- [ ] batch for get hidden states
  - [x] and cache
  - [x] 9s vs 60. so 10x faster


# 2023-05-21 11:26:20

- [ ] BUG: for some reason the model it not working as zero shot
  - OK I don't think it's the prompt? it must be my tokens? Lets make a scratch notebook to try and just load llama correctly
- [ ] also I would like to eval on some custom deceptive statements

# 2023-05-25 17:07:37

Hmm is sigmoid a good idea?

Lets just get hideen states once

- [ ] make the answer good? maybe with one shot
- [ ] fix prompt. so we have qeustion, true answer


Start again:
- [ ] the model can deceive (test) or not (train)
- [ ] the model can give an answer both in generate and forward
- [x] we can get hidden states (cached)


What is each step actually doing?
- we are finding a latent space direction that correspond to truth, sure
- but truth of what? what it's read, or what it's generating!?!
- what's it read presumably. but that's not what we are interested in. We are interested in the truth of what it generated which is quite different
- so how to we get the truth of what it generated?


How about human? well you give me an article, and ask me to complete is. I notice a lie in the article? I decide to lie to you as well?.

Now you give me extended article to another ai, and ask if there is a lie in there? that might work
but we would rather know if the generated thing is true, from the mind of the one who generated it

so that means we actually need the hidden states DURING GENERATION!

now generation is slow. so we should make it generate just a y/n.


# 2023-05-28 10:12:54

I need a model that will lie to me for the test set?... they are not very consistent. 

Maybe with
- better search
- manual pruning of generations?

I guess this shows they they trained whether the text it read is true... because that's much simpler


# 2023-05-28 16:46:38

bug: so there are two no tokens... wtf
the model only uses one! wtf!

oh it's _No vs No. One is the start of a new word. E.g. " No" and "\nNo" are _No. But "No" is "No"


Q for elk
- why int16 quant of hidden states? oh for the datasets package! I see https://github.com/EleutherAI/elk/issues/208
- why use forward not generate?
  - forward is what it thought of the last token?
  - generate is what it thinks of the generated tokens, conditional on what it read. 
- The later seems much closer to mind reading, and much closer to what we want
- additionally I've made this change in a PR and get X results

# 2023-05-29 07:09:38

Note we are using normalized for sklearn and it seems easy?
but unnorm for CCS, hmm

I can't get it to reliably lie, even at 30B. Grrr. Maybe an unaligned model?

OK so I asked on discord
- why not use generate? A: too hard, and how to make sure it's an answer (solution is to use relative probs and a single work). So they just haven't gone there.
- and how to make it lie. one person used yes momentum, nad it worked for them.

I would like to try:
- [ ] lying larry. with a larry prompt. and larry response.
- [ ] I could also keep sampling untill I get the prob diff I want! :)
  - the second actually seems better. since it can make sure that the pairs are the same except the answer!!


so wait
- how often are the pairs opposite answers? :(

So with the tuples:
- sometimes both are the same, making one a lie
- sometimes they are contrasting

So I could collect...
- valid contrasting answer? ... this seem inelegant as I've got no garuntees how long it will take
- find some way to generate random inference hidden states... so far it seem deterministic... maybe use mc dropout!!


# OK I'm trying to find a model with dropout... most of them dont

note that you can check in the model config

- llama no
- opeansssistant no
- redpyjamas? no
- falcan? has dropout but no effect
- "stabilityai/stablelm-tuned-alpha-7b" has dropout but no effect
- [pythia](https://huggingface.co/OpenAssistant/oasst-sft-4-pythia-12b-epoch-3.5). has dropout but no effect
- dolly: has dropout but no effect... wait no dropout in config
- [MPT](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-7b/blob/main/config.json):


**but it looks like most of them are usingt an attention path that bypasses**

worst case I can use that momentum. I'm still judging it on it's answer. It's just that I really want it to know it's lying.

side note: popular large models like LLaMA, Gopher, Chinchilla, GPT-3, and PaLM did not use dropout, since it can slow down learning.

- "stabilityai/stablelm-tuned-alpha-7b" # has dropout

# 2023-06-08 07:20:48

Goal: get it lie, knowing it can lie
Extra: get contrastive pairs

TODO:
- try monte carlo dropout?
  - get stablm working
    - need proper prompting?
    - then add dropout, and see if that helps with pairs..
    - (or maybe add noise? augmentation?)
- [ ] use talk to llm model cards
- [ ] just use forward...
- [ ] get some stats on yes, no, lie yes, lie no...
- [ ] find a way to randomize

How does generation work anyway? [so](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/ba695c1efd55091e394eb59c90fb33ac3f9f0d41/src/transformers/generation/utils.py#L2338) it looks like it's just a forward. where `next_token_logits = outputs.logits[:, -1, :]`. Where logits are from `lm_logits = self.lm_head(hidden_states)`

Note default logits_processor is LogitsProcessorList([]) where it doesn't do anything as it's empty


So how do a I turn a forward into the next token....
- I go `outputs.logits[:, -1, :].softmax(-1).argmax(-1)`


```
model_inputs = self.prepare_inputs_for_generation(input_ids, **model_kwargs)
outputs = model(**model_inputs, return_dict=True)
next_token_logits = outputs.logits[:, -1, :]
next_tokens_scores = logits_processor(input_ids, next_token_logits)
next_tokens = torch.argmax(next_tokens_scores, dim=-1)
```

OK so know I know that greedy 1 token generation IS the same as forward. BUT I still have the same problem. Am I seperating the model acting on a lie, or **knowingly generating a lie with high prob?**

:bug: why does mcdropout not work!?! Why is it deterministic? Can I inject noise?


Hmm base models seem better, since they are not trained for honesty!



So maybe I should see IF I can get many shot, acc=0.9 without lies. Then I can add lies.


stylaised knowledge:
- the prompt matters
- I don't know if the size of the model matters
- I don't know if the type of model matters


How to get the prompt? more direct. Just a lying one. Just a true one.


Maybe just try:
"The following movie review expresses what sentiment?" just like in ELK and lillian wangs...


BUG FIXME... I was returning the answers for the last shot... so totally random, jeeze

# 2023-06-10 18:01:30

It seems to be working now... but there is data leakage, where the midn read know more than the model.... so it's not using the models knowledge... it's cheating


So asking:
- "Classify the sentiment of the given movie review, "positive" or "negative"." with "TheBloke/Wizard-Vicuna-13B-Uncensored-HF" gave 96% acc truth. but 0% acc lie. 95% lie detec
- Using "Is it negative" w "openaccess-ai-collective/manticore-13b" got 75% acc_truth. 90% lie detection
- as above, "elinas/llama-13b-hf-transformers-4.29"/"LLMs/AlpacaGPT4-LoRA-13B-elina" got 74% acc

Prompting:
- "Classify the sentiment " gives good acc_true=0.97, and poor acc_lie=0
- "You are Loki who always lies...." acc_true=100, acc_lie=12

so learnings:
- So 13B model is good sweet spot for dev for me
- base models are better than uncensored models for lying

# 2023-06-11 10:15:45

What if I do mcdropout, and look at two pairs. One if more truth full. They don't even need to be fully lie and truth. Then I will in an unsupervised manner have truth?

Ideally I do make a question that invites lying sometimes.

# Chat gpt on two headed liars


  Cheshire Cat 

  Sphinx with two heads

  Two gaurds

  Two headed giant

  There are two guards standing at two separate doors. One door leads to safety, while the other leads to danger. One guard always tells the truth, and the other guard always lies. You don't know which guard is which or which door leads to safety.


  The tale of the Two-Headed Giant is a common motif in folklore and fantasy literature. In this story, a giant creature possesses two heads that represent conflicting personalities—one head that tells the truth, and the other that consistently lies. The Two-Headed Giant often guards a treasure or obstructs the path of heroes.

  To overcome the challenge posed by the Two-Headed Giant, the protagonist must navigate through its deceitful statements and determine the correct path or obtain vital information. The hero or heroine must ask questions strategically to discern which head speaks the truth and which one lies.

  The challenge of the Two-Headed Giant highlights the importance of critical thinking, discernment, and the ability to outsmart or decipher the conflicting information presented by the two heads. By asking the right questions or exploiting the Giant's weaknesses, the protagonist can overcome the obstacle and proceed on their quest or retrieve the treasure.

  The Sphinx riddle is another well-known storytelling motif featuring a creature with the head of a human and the body of a lion. In this tale, the Sphinx blocks the entrance to a city or guards a particular location, challenging anyone who wishes to pass with a riddle. The riddle posed by the Sphinx typically involves a clever wordplay or a challenging question.

  One famous example of the Sphinx's riddle is: "What creature walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening?" The answer to this riddle is "Man." In the morning of life, humans crawl on all fours as infants, representing four legs. At noon, they walk on two legs as adults. In the evening of life, they use a walking stick, representing three legs.

  The Sphinx's riddle represents a test of wit and intelligence. If the challenger fails to answer the riddle correctly, the Sphinx devours them. However, those who successfully solve the riddle are allowed to pass. The tale of the Sphinx and its riddle highlights the importance of critical thinking, problem-solving, and the ability to unravel complex or enigmatic puzzles.

# Dropout

Why does dropout not work? It's in the training of models and of lora... yet it seems to be stripped out an bypassed during inference.

e.g. https://huggingface.co/OpenAssistant/falcon-7b-sft-top1-696

So now I need to get a falcan model to work reliably... or maybe I should change to pythia or dolly

# How to enable dropout in language models?

- put into train mode `model.train()`
- turn on in config
```
config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(model_repo)
config.hidden_dropout=0.2
config.use_cache=False
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_repo, config=config, **model_options)
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(
    model,
    lora_repo, 
    lora_dropout=0.2,
)
```
- turn of cache `model.forward(input_ids use_cache=False)`
- possibly avoid 4bit and 8bit?

# 2023-06-11 20:07:48

So now I need to get a falcan model to work reliably... or maybe I should change to pythia or dolly. As long as it has dropout

Also I need to try the starcoder model

OK I got MCdropout working. Negative results. I can't predict the truth from that.... weird.

No... it just give bad answrs


learning
- wizard coder works well for getting sentiment :)
- but as far a detection lies from mcdropout... no!


exp
- ~~what if, I use attention? well it's per token.. which isn't what we can use~~
- [x] what about a large N? yes it seems to help!
- [ ] what about I don't use 4bit? will that help
- [ ] scaling..
- [ ] but it all in datamodule?
- [ ] Now that it works, maybe try a probe?!?


https://github.com/wassname/discovering_latent_knowledge/blob/main/notebooks/004_mjc_CCS_v2.ipynb

# 2023-06-17 11:10:15

How do we arrange this. In the original CCS
- two groups, ones ask if it's positive, the other negative. each has a random actual label.

In mine:
- pairs: each one is randomly dropped out so they are separated in some latent space. there is a true label y. And each one in the pair, one is closer to the truth, the other further.

So each try to divine the true y from the hidden states

So I could arrange it... work out which one has the high probability of truth and order. Nah

So my choices for y: 
- I can try and detect the true answer from hidden states: this is what CCS does, I use the true answer as y
- Or try and detect deception: I use true_answer===given_answer? but then what about unintentional lies? ~10 of the time.



The first one is more universally useful.


In the CCS paper the model doesn't know which group is which in a given batch. But it must distinguish between them as best it can.

This wont work for me as mine as they are not separated into two groups. They are instead separated by some magnitude (p1-p2) and some direction/ranking. 

So instead we can try and prediction the magnitude (unsupervised), or the direction (unsupervised), or both (I guess this is supervised).


## So wait what is my setup:

- given a model which has dropout enabled
- (we do greedy generation of a single token. the prompt asks for a binary answer)
- we do two inferences on the same inputs. Since we have dropout enabled, even during inference, we get two slightly different hidden states `hs1` and `hs2`, and two slightly different probabilities on our yes and no output tokens `p1` `p2`. We also have the true answer `y`
- so given this pair of hidden states `hs1` and `hs2`, we want to know which one is more true. We know that the one which gives the highest probability of `y` is the ground truth.

So we can set this up in many ways

- the input is a vector, expressing the difference between the pair `model(hs1-hs2)==(p1-p2)*y`. And we want to work out which direction is closer to the truth.
- `model(hs1)-model(hs2)=(p1-p2)*y` where the model just takes in a single hs and we rank the outputs. This is like in CCS with it's unsupervised ranked losses.

Can we predict deception? No, because the pair are both either deception or not. But we can predict private truth, and compare to public statement. Half our data is deceptive to we can test on deception in this manner.


spel wrongg test here.

 d "frenc" "test" hmm Polski
  

# how does the loss from CCS work?

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.03827.pdf

-  First, we use the fact that a statement and its negation should have probabilities that add up to 1
-  However, this objective alone has a degenerate solution: p(x+) = p(x−) = 0.5. To avoid this problem, we encourage the model to also be confident with the following confidence lo

# so what loss can I use

- supervised
- ranking. here I do MCDropout 3 times. Then I try to rank them. There should be two similar and 2 differen't. 
  - 1 could be a lie
  - 2 could be truth?


exp:
- [ ] try getting dual notebook working
  - [x] first recache the dataset
  - [ ] note dual means we pass both x0 and x1 into the model. rather than i9ndependant passes

BUGS:
- [ ] metrics: acc is averaged over epochs, change to auroc and make per val train
- [ ] it's overfitting. maybe removing first and last layers?
- [x] 017 mjc getting hidden layers doesn't work anymore?
  - [x] fix caching. ah it was just a bad test for difference fixed
- [ ] memory leak now... it just goes up...


# 2023-07-06 14:38:18

How general is it?
- does it work across tasks?
- across prompts?
- 
Oh no... the lies are far apart... maybe I should normalise the distance! No it's fine


Oh wait... it's not lying! bloody hell!
How can I make it lie?

# I need a model that will lie

Styalized facts about getting a model to lie:
- a logic model is better, for example a coding model
- a larger model might help
- an uncensored model will help a lot
- a good jailbroken prompt will help a lot


Experiment, try varius uncensored model. Mix of coding, larger, etc.
Run with N=100 and seeb if they lie...

# whats my task

have the weights been permuted in the direction of....

- inner truth - balanced, always available, but not quite what we care about
- inner falsehood
- deception - 
  - when the model is told to lie, and it lies
  - or it could be, when the model can answer, but doesn't (this requires differen't data prep....), and takes 2x as long
  - although here there are 3 possiblilities
    - mistaken
    - lying
    - truth

are we asking CHOICE TODO
- for hs1 is it deceiving?
- or is hs1-hs2 in the direction of deception?


Maybe I should
- do a lie and non lie prompt.
- have classes [true, mistake, lie]

TODO CHOICE

|       | knows   | unkown |
| ----- | ------- | ------ |
| right | correct | luck   |
| wrong | lie     | wrong  |


# what do I care about?

the truth or deception? deception.

and generalisation.

I can hone in as much as I can

So train for deception as closely as possible.

If I use all 4 classes I can say which answer is closer to correct, luck, lie, wrong.. it sounds like a fascinating thing if it works!


# 2023-07-09 08:14:22

OK so I tried to do it with 3 type of prompt: lie, true and simple. The simple one was meant to measure the model capacity to do the task... but it was really low. Wat?!


Oh it was because I asked it to say negative, but it REALLY wanted to say Negative. OK. 
So measuring a simple prompt: 95%, and measuring the complex true prompt: 94%, so not worth the 2x slowdown.
****
# 2023-07-13 18:21:20

- [ ] do the triple label experiment
- [ ] do mc ranking for deception?

Where were we? Oh I now have paired lie and no lie. The no lie is 94% so it should give us some idea of when it knows it.

Now I can try that 4 class one. Actually I will merge the two unknown classes as we do not have the information to **distinguish**


|       | knows   | unknown |
| ----- | ------- | ------- |
| right | correct | unknown |
| wrong | lie     | unknown |


And in terms of putting them into the model. Do I want 
- MC ranking: model(x)>model(y)
  - this is really ranking loss, and I can use montecarlo dropouts
- model(x, y)>0, which seems to work better but might it be cheating?
- model(x)=class? 
  - which is the simplest. 
  - I'm really saying, given these hidden states is the model going to be
    - unsure
      - I can get this for when I know it's wrong. That means internal and external uncertainty, but the model can probobly only do internal
      - Or I could use something like MCDropout but then we have further subclasses
        - unconfident wrong
        - unconfident right
        - confident wrong
    - deceptive
    - sure
  - or
    - truth
    - lie
    - unsure/mistake/random
- 


I could do just the ones where it is given examples lie? but sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't

" Ranking Losses is to predict relative distances between inputs. This task if often called metric learning."

But I do have 2 and I know the direciton


We could have true>unsure>lie

- exp: if we use distance, and mse or smoothl1loss then we do a bit better ~50% notebooks/019_mjc_ranking_distance.ipynb
  - and with better hparams we get 86%!
  - this kind of makes sense? now what if we normalize? 65% notebooks/019_mjc_distance_mse_norm.ipynb
  - subtract and norm? 72% notebooks/019_mjc_distance_mse_subt_norm.ipynb
- exp: what about just classify direction? 66% 
- OH it turn out the loss curve is weird, as the modedl si too small...

- [ ] Not very good? What if we normalize the hidden states in one of a few ways
  - [ ] each neurons
  - [ ] the total magnitude

ideas:
- normalize
- only wory about direction, nothing else. so it's a class
- actually remove the 4% of confusion, it might significantly overlap with the 10% of lies!... but oh wait we are looking at direction right now
- for that matter we have ans1 and ans2 and one might be a lie and one migth not in another ~4% of cases
- maybe I should dropout the first few layers and measure the next?
- hs1-hs2

# 2023-07-20 08:53:24

I would like a better score than 82% but when independant models are getting similar rates then meh.

- [ ] Exp: clean data, more data
  - [x] Only the ones where it knows the answer
  - [x] Only the ones with significant permuations
  - [x] More data (using map to transform)
  - [ ] results...?... it's broken lol
- Exp: test generalization other prompts
  - what's the accuracy with multiple dropouts? does it help?

150*6

Oh when I limited it to answers that moved by more than 5%, it did poorly
maybe if I divide by that?


what about `(hs1-hs2)/dProb`? And then cls direction?


Ah found the bug! I shuffled the dataset for X, but then drew y from the unshuffled lol! FML

:poop: :poop: :poop: 


Hmm so a linear model gets 70%, and all my models get only 73% lol. This is with all "accident" rows removed...

So what next? A differen't way o toiew the data?

Oh I can rerun my norm ones..


# 2023-07-21 21:44:17

Good result. notebooks/020_mjc_ranking_loss_w_scaling_big_moves_94% copy.ipynb

Here is get 71% with a linear prob. But 89% with a ranking loss model!

I might be able to restrict it to large dprobs and tune to get an even better result!

Perhaps I can do linear probes on a subset to explore some dims?

:notebook: ranking loss performs better, learning more, managing deeper networks, not overfitting.

This makes sense for several reasons:
- the network has no realitive information it can use to overfit
- it has absolute information on activations, which may be importanst as it's operating on a multidimensional optimisation surface, where absolute position may give important informaiton. As an analogy imagine you are on a gold course, which is more usefull, knowledge that two balls are 2 meters apart and a 30deg incline. Or that that 2 meters is between the top of a small hill and the other a sandpit, with the 30 deg incline between them. Absolute information seems important!


exp
- opt
  - [ ] can I get above 89% with hyperopt?
  - [ ] can I get above 89% with test time mcdropout?
  - [ ] how does a change in min dDrop change things? maybe with lienar
- [ ] obj
  - [x] Triplet loss? I just need to make more mcdropouts
    - So I move B close to A and C far from A. 
    - So I would need a mcdropout that did not move it far
    - And another that did
    - nah it doesn't make sense, as I havet exact distances
  - Modify Margin Ranking Loss to have softlabel? or is it jsut mse?
  - [ ] try margin=0.2
  - [ ] try just mse distance... wait mse makes distance not matter... no
    - [ ] YES! 95% auc. 90% acc and more stable :)
- [ ] ds
  - [ ] prompts
  - [ ] does result generalzie between datasets? truthfull qa


TODO
- test with diff prompt e.g please lie, e.g. please tell truth, e.g. give random answer
  - can we do this interactivly? or a very small dataset with random prompt the model comes up with?
- test with truthfullqa https://huggingface.co/datasets/EleutherAI/truthful_qa_binary
  - maybe generate dataset?



# loss

OK if I modify the margin loss.... 
- right now it says if the direction is right then 0 loss, but if the direction wrong then punish dependong on far away
- [x] margin says that it has to be at least this far in the right direction! (try this)


- If I want to say if should be this far away. don't use mse as I want direction!
- MAE.. no
- just distance? yes!


- a different activation I don't care
- what about


idea:
- what if we don't flatten layer but conv over them?
- what if we embed position!

exp
- nb: try to grok with high weight decay sicne with margin it seems more stable...
- emb: try conv.. wIP
- no true switch... wait why did I switch it.. .weight
- wait what 93% baseline wat?? oh wait we are just detecting the word positive lol! ignore this

TODO
- refactor to look like the psudocode


# 2023-07-23 19:50:10

Where was I?
- 03_ds_TQA: trying to make a new OOS dataset
- 023 I got up to 90% acc and 96% roc_auc


03_ds_TQA... make sure 
- [ ] true false is right, 
- [ ] acc


TruthfullQA:
- make sure it can get it right


- [ ] OK maybe my own curated set?
- [ ] Or just make a quick one to test manually...

Refactoring
- [ ] move common functs to src
  - [x] probe
  - [x] load model
  - [x] get_hidden_states
  - [x] get_choices_as_tokens
  - [ ] prompt format
- [ ] get it working :poop:
  - [ ] dataset
  - [ ] model

So wait do I need to just record scores

Now how does this all relate to truth and the prompt 

So we are measuring if a particular token, that is could have answered with is true... but the model doesn't know which one!!!
So it seems like there is some experimentation needed here. I should just save scores which will give me optionality.

But really I should be looking at the most likely token right? No need for a choice?
All I need to so is decide if this hidden state is more true.
But if I chose an unlikely answer it seems misleading?

Maybe I should be looking at hidden state condictional on a token. But how to do that?

Well I'm really trying to tell if the most likely answer is true. So I just need to work out if the most likely answer is true using the labels. Then I can order the hidden states.


# Collect hidden state pairs

The idea is this: given two pairs of hidden states, where everything is the same except r dropout. Then tell me which one is more truthfull? 

If this works, then for any inference, we can see which one is more truthfull. Then we can see if it's the lower or higher probability one, and judge the answer and true or false.

Steps:
- collect pairs of hidden states, where the inputs and outputs are the same. We modify the random seed and dropout.
- Each pair should have a binary answer. We can get that by comparing the probabilities of two tokens such as Yes and No.
- Train a prob to distinguish the pairs as more and less truthfull
- Test probe to see if it generalizes

So right now generation is not working... but pipeline is. Why is that? Is thrre something I removed? Or the way I tokenizer?

oh no actually generation is not working either, so it might be the prompt. Or that padding

ok it might be the padding!... it was!


Lesson: padding can lead to weird outputs so it's best to use an attention mask to ignore it


- [x] revisit refactor?
- [x] round up the FIXME TODO UPTO HACK's
- [x] get model nb working
  - [ ] tidy
- [ ] do multiple datasets (esp TruthfullQA) adverseria_qa commonsense_qa. 
  - [ ] in fact can I consume elk [defs](https://github.com/EleutherAI/elk/blob/main/elk/promptsource/templates/adversarial_qa/adversarialQA/templates.yaml)?


# 2023-08-07 08:24:43

Oh no it's not generalising. And I realised that by having multiple duplicate datasets I was mixing test and train duh! Start again

- normalise stops it from overfitting... or learnign at all? What's going on. Did I mix up test train os hs1 hs2?

huh in the dm notebook I get 100 and 60% with linear cls. But in 023 I get 100 50% weird. And with norm I get 50% 50%

:bug: I had hs0 hs0, wtf

err so manbe ranking is not the best! do I need to try other models again?

- [ ] try other setups? cls, (hs0-hs1)/y etc
- [ ] try restricting to question where it can answer it?
- [ ] try removign truncated ones?


wait what? when the model tries to lie... we get this acc 0.49


wait
- test metrics says it works
- but train and val don't!
- and my custon ones dont?


on one hand we have acc at prob predicting ans1>ans2
on the other prob at predicting label
on another llm at answer

So I can predict if one is more positvie than other
at least using ranking loss. hmm


wooo true and label are diff!!! even tho they come from the same source :bug:

found the bug, I shuffled X but not y  lol

# 2023-08-12 12:45:15

It doesn't seem to generalize to the new datasets....

- **although we can't seem to LEARN the new datasets either so there may be something wrong with them**
  - Maybe it's just to hard? As TQA is actually hard? 
  - [x] add the "check it knows" thing
    - [ ] yeah it doesn't know. 50% accuracy against a 50% baseline

- what tricks does ELK have?
- Maybe I just need more diverse datasets and prompts in order to generalise?
  - E.g. not just gaurds
  - E.g. not just true false?
  - in this case I might need to fork elk?
    - well as well as varying inputs and chocies I need to
      - [ ] add mcdropout
      - [ ] check the model knows the truth
      - [ ] make sure the model lies ~10-90% of the time, even when it knows the answer.... This is opposed to elk where it reads a lie. For this I can inject syste prompts?
  - [ ] Can I just do synthetic data? E.g. 1+1=3? https://huggingface.co/datasets/math_dataset/blob/main/math_dataset.py
  - [ ] https://huggingface.co/datasets/datacommons_factcheck
  - [ ] https://huggingface.co/datasets/diplomacy_detection


Essentially I've found a solution that finds the hidden state with more truth, but it does not generalize. I've got reason to think I'm onto a possiblity of generalization, since my solution in invariant to prompt. But it's normal to need a lot of varied data to force a good solution!


So my new dataset setup should have these properties
- binary choices
  - [ ] false ture
  - [ ] no yes
  - [ ] negative positive
- [ ] should be easily solvable by the model!
  - I can do a test batch to make sure:
    - acc is high
    - my choices are likely
  - prompt fmt as defined by arguents:
    - version -> instruction, char
    - choices



In the mean time lets check if TQA acc is high.... notebooks/03b_make_dataset_TQA_true_false_SCRATCH.ipynb

- [ ] TQA pretty much fails.... find another OOS easy dataset. It's too hard to a small model
- [ ] Mabe facts, logic, or simple arithmetic?




# 2023-08-13 11:42:06

UPTO
- I shared my psuecode in discord. Crickets
- I tried forking ELK so that I could use it's prompts. It's complex... but maybe I I only use it's questions it will be easier and better?
  - because their one shots are sometimes repeats.. but it's OK
  - but the questions are good in that they have binary choices?
  - just install elk, and use their prompts!
  - I will need to
    - make sure they have 2 choices
    - inject preamble to make them lie >10% of the time
    - chose easy dataset

# 2023-08-18 09:32:54

So the work really is getting the datasets going.

It makes sense to use minimal ELK stuff like prompts

but I can't just copy it because I need to make sure
- 2 choices
- preamble
- easy datasets, or datasets with an answer

notebooks/01_scratch_elk.ipynb

# 2023-08-19 12:58:04


- [x] add sysinst that is random for each one. Various statements to make it lie part of the time. I could also just do qlora like ELK
  - [x] prompts are differen't ways of asking the question
  - [x] sysinst are differen't commands that might make it lie, tell the truth, or be unsure
- [x] add the ability to lie in the multishots
- [ ] check lies and multishots!
- [ ] add cfg
- [ ] what about chatml vs llama format??
  - [ ] I can add a metatemplate with [q, a] and [sys, rest]

But wait, how much does the preamble contribute to the lies, and how much does the multishot?? Need to run an experiment to understand this.

# 2023-08-25 08:59:59

On discord someone pointed that my approach of taking deception as: wrong answer where it could otherwise answer them has a flaw. What if you then increase the answer with CoT/MultiShot/better prompting. Then it turns out it could answer all along, it's just that your prompting was confusing. The examples where this is true seem to be a case of the model being confused, rather than deceptive.

We have these categories of examples:
- that it can always solve "sentiment of terrible"
- that it can solve only with advanced prompting methods. This seems to be examples where it's confused about what the user wants "e.g. step on a crack break you fathers..."
- the ones it could solve with the best prompting methods
- that it can never solve because it does not know  "who is the president of the UWA in 2040"


# 2023-08-25 12:28:24

OK we have all the pieces. Lets build it

- config object
- chose a random true and false one for each example?
- do 1000. and see which sys prompts helped?

# 2023-08-26 16:39:31

# 2023-08-27 13:38:33

So I got a dataset I want to

- try training a probe on expnses probs
- look at diff between probs and expanded probs
- looks at llm acc by dataset, lie by dataset, prob acc by dataset
- finally look at generaliation


results are :poop: 

Maybe with multiple mc dropout iteractions it would be easier? I could even do it at test time with voting?
Or multi ranking?

What if I remove one's it can't do. Then how do I know

# 2023-08-31 08:21:38

- with new dataset we can remove unsure
- maybe I can try multiple mc dropout iteractions... esp by combining dataset
- test time ranking? multi dropouts?

twitter conv https://twitter.com/GreatKingCnut/status/1696862086205473009

Experiment: expanded token def... 0.66 anyway
Experiment: going from mse to margin improved acc 0.66 or 60->0.68% as well
Experiment: removing the 30% of rows it can't answer 0.74%? (nb 0.24)
Experiment: group neurons to prevent overfitting?

Question: LLama does not have dropout. alternatives to MCDropout?

What about conv? not over width, but over depth?

hs size is batch, neurons, layers
I am running conv on this so [b, neurons=features, layers=spatial]. So yes that's interesting.
torch.Size([120, 6144, 37])

How to I make it not overfit? Maybe I split into sections?
The layer dimension is an actual dimension... but the others are arbitrary.

What about:
- torch.Size([120, 1, 6144, 37])
- Conv2d(1, 3, (1, 3))
- torch.Size([120, 3, 6144, 35])
- - Conv2d(1, 30, (10, 1))
- AvgPool!
- NN
- but this means we can only look at neurons in the same column... and that's meaningless

Really I care about the 6144x6144 connections between layers.

# 2023-09-01 14:40:53 back to the drawing board

This twitter conv twitter conv https://twitter.com/GreatKingCnut/status/1696862086205473009

made me think monte carlo dropout might not provide the information needed. But what about the gradient? 

Let me think how to set this up. So let's say we know:
- hs: the hidden states for each neuron
- dhs: the gradient for each neuron with respect to
  - the opposite answer? I guess this adds another dimension
  - the truth? but that leaks info



But if we give it the gradient from the loss, if that has the rigth answer in then it's data leakage and wont work during deployment

Hmm it's not so easy as there are many layers. And each is huge. I may need to use captum.

maybe one of these techniques
- https://captum.ai/api/neuron.html#neuron-guided-backprop omputes the gradient of the target neuron with respect to the input
- https://captum.ai/api/neuron.html#neuron-gradient   output of a particular neuron with respect to the inputs of the network.

I may need to modify a method! https://github.com/pytorch/captum/blob/master/captum/_utils/gradient.py


# 2023-09-02 12:41:43
Problem: how to actually get gradioents?
- [ ] Counterfactual? 
  - what is it?   
  - Counterfactuals, hypothetical examples that show people how to obtain a different prediction.
- [ ] Neuron attribution? I would need to change from input to output
  - [ ] Can I find a simple repo?
  - somehow they schoe input or output  Computes the gradient of the output of a particular neuron with respect to the inputs of the network.

torch.autograd.grad 

OK it's too hard how about this

- just do each layer
- just do the last MLP
- and it's output neurons (need to work out how to do this... maybe reshape them sum over input?)


For having gradient I need bf16, which is 4x as large. That means I cannot fit a 15B model like starcoder. Which 7b model to try?
- https://huggingface.co/digitalpipelines/llama2_7b_chat_uncensored
- https://huggingface.co/WizardLM/WizardCoder-Python-7B-V1.0

there is also the 3b and 1b coding models
- https://huggingface.co/WizardLM/WizardCoder-3B-V1.0
- https://huggingface.co/WizardLM/WizardCoder-1B-V1.0

# which layers... this is an interesting choice

https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kuQfnotjkQA4Kkfou/inference-time-intervention-eliciting-truthful-answers-from?commentId=bzJpeGjbEDAKDdJiX

  They use train a linear probe on the for the activations of every attention head (post attention, pre W^O multiplication) to classify T vs F example answers. They see which attention heads they can successfully learn a probe at. They select the top 48 attention heads (by classifier accuracy).

  For each of these heads they choose a “truthful direction” based on the difference of means between T and F example answers. (Or by using the direction orthogonal to the probe, but diff of means performs better.)

This is interesting as they do not use hidden states. They use attention head outputs hmm

then they only take the top 48 attentions heads, and only direction

# 2023-09-03 19:51:18

So I have it making a dataset. I still need to work out the label. And I need a large sample.

But the worst thing is I've got from 15B models with a batch of 10, to 3B models with a batch of 1 (1/50x). Just by going from 4bit to 16 (4x) but also adding gradient/graph (contributed 10x?).

# 2023-09-04 06:29:58

A quick linear probe gets 77% acc on test set. hmm


hmm los of interesting stuff in this code https://github.com/likenneth/honest_llama/blob/master/utils.py#L17
- datasets
- models
- getting hidden states

# 2023-09-05 18:30:16

OK wow using the mlp grads gets 80%

plus I think I only used one layer :bug:

plus there are other ideas! Like flipping the sign of the label and grad
like hidden states plus grad
like 2 hidden states, some from updating weights then inference?

using this https://github.com/davidbau/baukit/blob/main/baukit/nethook.py

# 2023-09-07 12:28:02

- [x] multi layers
- [x] use nethook
- [ ] think of ways to make the pair clear but also low mem use...
  - gradients add a lot. so can I reverse some heads?
  - [ ] should I update virtual weights and run again? with no grad? that would be clear. how much grad would it use... maybe not much


result of multi layers and tracedict...
mlp 76%
attn 75%

previouslly I was extracting the grad on the weights. now it's the grad on the outputs/activations which seems better although perhaps harder to classify!

# 2023-09-09 08:06:54

- [ ] run probe on some data
- [ ] add a mlp one too
- [ ] try some alternative with updating a copy of weights to get alt score and hidden states!
- [ ] try to work out why so much mem?!
  - oh it's def the graph. just huge! from 7-9g to 25g even with bfloat16
    - with or without tracedict
    not much I can do


what if I, instead of -probs. I switch yes and no!


OK it hard to find a counterfactual one.. A single up date can go to far. And we can enter degenater cases like ones that say 

>  negativenegativenegativenegativenegative

But I've also found good ones. Hmm

My current hypothesis:
- It would be nice to compare a pair of counterfactual samples, but this presents difficulties. These are, firstly it's time consuming to produce a counterfactual. Secondly this might give away which the true one is, and the counterfacual might be obviously synthetic is if stands out in someway
- Instead I will give the probe the weigths updates that backprop predicts. That is, the gradients to go from the current prediction to the opposite predict. Sure this will sometimes update to much and so on but I leave that to the probe to sort out. This gradient information may be usefull to the probe as it shows which weights were important, and in which direction.
  - So if a "truth neuron" is important then it's gradient will be large. And perhaps the gradient direction will show a direction of truth or lie.
  - I can either try the gradient on the weights (low dimensional but less info) or the gradient on the outputs (more relevent, but it must be gradients on a much more variable landscape
  
  
Now this whole thing uses a lot of memory. Lets see if I can do it with the 3B model. But potentially I can fix this by note backpropogating all the way back through ~600 tokens. Can I just do the last few tokens? Or even the last one? I might be able to do that by specifying the inputs.. although they are not the tokens!

I can probobly pass in input embeds fddirectoy
ok... no even if  I do that, it still uses just as much memory....
maybe I can parse all but the last token, then just do the next token based on detached hidden states?


```py
  # create position_ids on the fly for batch generation
  position_ids = attention_mask.long().cumsum(-1) - 1
  position_ids.masked_fill_(attention_mask == 0, 1)
  inputs_embeds = self.wte(input_ids)
  position_embeds = self.wpe(position_ids)
```

# 2023-09-10 10:23:49

try to improve data loading
- improve prompt stuff meh didn't help! Maybe I can make it iterative

tried to improve memory
- only doing part of the rollout with grad... this is not how transformers work, hidden state doesn't seem to passed along iteratively. I should have know.
- tried specifying inptus to grad as only input_embeds, or part of them. Neither freeds memory or even was able to update the weights!
- [ ] try freezing some weights?

- **OH backprop to the embedding weights worked where the input_embed diddn't :star:!** e.g. this gives a bit less mem used

except it does seem to use more mem after a few?
```py
inputs_embeds = model.transformer.wte(input_ids)
outputs = model(inputs_embeds=inputs_embeds)
loss = calc_loss(outputs)
loss.backward(inputs=model.transformer.wte.weight)
```


## Where am I up to? 

well I've given up on improving the memory for now. I'd like to look up more on counterfactual examples, but it doesn't feel prospective. 

I would like to get a big grad dataset and try a probe to see if I can go from the linear probe acc of 80% to 95%. 

I would also like to work out which parts I need to save to get a good prediction. Is it the head activations. Only the grads? Or the MLP. Knowing this will save me momory

hmm looks at this, in they use torch.autograd to backpropr to noise on the embeddings https://github.com/microsoft/KEAR/blob/7376a3d190e5c04d5da9b99873abe621ae562edf/model/perturbation.py#L60

wow I got 96% wit ha lienar prob and head_activation_and_grad !!

oh but in the breakdown it's not getting the lies? or is that just my label?

:bug: oh so in the amazon polarity ones, the prompt has an extra \n... that doesn't fit for me. I have an example with two \n, but then a prompt with one...

hmm I need to dive into this, maybe if I always use a blank answer


:star: ah I was truncating the prompt. 1 shot seems better

UPTO redo imdb but with 1 shot, and therefore less mem and truncating of sys instructions...

So I get almost 100% somehow, even with a linear probe!. Where is it cheating? It's cutting a lot based on ones it doesn't know... is it unbalancing it?

Without cutting the 50% it doesn't know we get 78-85%, which is about how many it knows?

# 2023-09-11 20:35:32

Huh I can get near 100% on either imdb or amazon polarity but not both (more like 60%). Why is that?

Ideas:
- maybe I didn't need grads, just the outputs?
  - [x] OK with a linear prob: residual head gets 0% on lies. grads get 50%, so grads seems important but I should try mlp. It's worth together
- maybe I can use state representations like neel nanda does? he seems to use post_residual, what is what. oh wait's it's what I'm using but added together
- [x] maybe I can use a linear probe like https://github.com/likenneth/othello_world/blob/f23bb5696cf30b93bd8af8a391ee33fc3aac417e/mechanistic_interpretability/tl_probing_v1.py#L97
  - meh it's just my model with one layer and no activation

Experiment!

| residual_stream_grads         | 0.5     | 0.47     |

conclusions:
- weight grads don't help
- head > residual > mlp
- grad_and_act > act > grad

So the best is head_grad_and_act

But given that head activation is good, and residual stream is good... perhaps I should use them? As they let me use a 4x larger model or batch


And yes the activation stream one get's 92%.11!
but the residual stream on gets 84% but that's not much when the balance is not even


OK so dice is better for loss and measuring acc like peformance. 

But when I used multiple datasets the performance degrades a lot! why is that?

# what datasets can I use?

right now just boolean as the binarize thing isn't working for either the sampler or fewshot

# 2023-09-16 13:32:00

Next I think I need to sanity check the datasets!
- normalize? or at least check dist
- visualize all data
- check key statistics: acc


then decidce on what we need to gather
